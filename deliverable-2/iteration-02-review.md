## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * Where: Online Through Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

<ol>
<li>We decided not to make any change to the input objects of financial calculating functions. Instead, we make a copy of the input object and only modify the copy. This avoids generating bugs in the functions which call the financial calculating functions.
</li>
<li>We decided to not use CI/CD as we believed it would make the process more complicated than it had to be while it would also limit each members knowledge of the product to their own features to work on, we instead chose to just have each member work on the assigned feature but when completed they must make a pull request and we review this pull request in our weekly meetings. We consider this decision to be successful because it forced each member to look at code that isn’t their own which allowed us to learn ways of implementing certain things that are easier and more efficient than our own solution.
</li>
<li>We decided mid-way between D1 and D2 to switch the main form of communication between the partner and our group to Slack, this decision is considered to be successful because it reduced the time both sides waited to receive a response and also allowed everybody in the group to apart of the conversation instead of just the designated person on both sides.
</li>
</ol>

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

<ol>
<li>Our decision to use D3js as our data visualization library hasn’t worked out as successfully as we had hoped as we have trouble integrating it with our React application.</li>
<li>Our decision to make each person work individually on each feature didn’t work out as well as we hoped as when we faced coding challenges we couldn’t necessarily look to other group members for help as some features required a lot of code and it would be difficult to bring others up to speed as to what we have done so far.</li>
<li>At the beginning of this project we chose to communicate exclusively using email which didn’t work well as the period in which it took to send/receive a response from both sides wasn’t ideal as it would sometimes require 24 hours before we could get a response which hinder some of our progress at the beginning.</li>
</ol>


#### Q3. Planned changes

<ol>
<li>We will be reassigning group members to features as before we chose to only assign one person to each feature and now we will be assigning two to each feature as having two people coding one feature allows for mutual aid when somebody faces a coding challenge or error.</li>
<li>We decided to change our meeting schedule with our partners from once a week to bi-weekly. We made this decision because we have made a slack group with them so any questions either of us have can be quickly answered on there.</li>
</ol>


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

We have email Adam and told him of our circumstances in which we couldn't schedule a meeting to demo our application to the partner before deliverable 2 is due but have already set a date which is Wednesday, November 25, 2020 at 12pm. Adam told us we could just update this portion of Iteration 02 after our demo on Wednesday.

Update:

We prepared for the demo by deploying the application which we would then display the features we have implemented to them through screen sharing on Zoom. The features which we were able to demo were the Login, Registration, Information Input, Debt and Retirement Scenario features. The partners accepted all the features implemented for the deployed application. There were a couple of change requests as the Debt Scenario Feature and Retirement Scenario Feature’s sliders need values to be added so the user understands what values they are sliding from, and to add an input box so the user can enter a custom amount. For the demo what we learned from the process is when presenting the demo don’t use very technical terms to describe our product as the partners are not software engineers so language that is too technical will make the demo more difficult for them to understand, so when presenting a demo use general terms as it will keep them engaged.
